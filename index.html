  My experience in the training so far has been an interesting one, first of all it made me versatile, I started as a Novice and because i want to learn, it made me do more research because i want to stand out among the best students. This is my first time of going into tech,everything was just new to me, i started by learning the basics of html and trying to understand the codes etc, it was difficult for me then but now i can  do most things by myself as there is improvement in my learing capability.<br><br>
